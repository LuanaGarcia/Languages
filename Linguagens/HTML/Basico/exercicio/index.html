        In nature, Good & Evil do not exist. The Universe itself is neither good
        nor bad, but a potential in permanent development.

      Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s
      perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about
      your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such thing
      as an issue.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if
      the brain doesn’t think it. Nothing exists neither if our senses don’t
      transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality
      changes. That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see
      at 360 degrees for example. If we mis translate the message, our reality
      changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that
      way. Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.

      They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that
      person as divine. Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls from
      clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But the
      person is the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works like that
      : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you passively do
      it anyway.

    <p class="text">
      Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
      evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, “We
      are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”
      The farmer said, “Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.” The next day the
      horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening
      everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of
      events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, “Is it good? Is
      it bad? I don't know.”
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
      riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, “Oh
      dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer responded, “Is it good? Is it bad? I
      don't know.” The next day the conscription officers came around to
      conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a
      broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that
      great!” Again, he said, “Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.”
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
      complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
      happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the
      consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
      consequences of good fortune.

      Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
